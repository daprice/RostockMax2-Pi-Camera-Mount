# Rostock Max PiPlate
Integrate any version of [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) with a [Camera Module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/) into the side panel of a [SeeMeCNC Rostock Max](http://www.seemecnc.com) 3D printer.

This allows you to mount the Raspberry Pi inside your printer and control the printer remotely using [OctoPrint](http://octoprint.org) or [AstroPrint](https://www.astroprint.com). The PiPlate is compeltely 3D printable and requires no extra hardware, other than what's needed for the Pi itself (e.g. [SeeMeCNC's Wifi 3D Printer Kit](http://www.seemecnc.com/collections/parts-accessories/products/raspberry-pi-wifi-3d-printer-kit).
